# TeXR RV1 Remote Controller Documentation

## Introduction:

Featuring RV1, the advanced wireless remote controller designed by TeXR team for all your robotics projects.
With its powerful Espressif esp32 microcontroller over WiFi using a modified Esp-now protocol, RV1 provides reliable and secure wireless control for a wide range of robotics or industrial projects.

Using the 2.4GHz ISM band, RV1 can wirelessly control projects such as RC cars, RC planes, Robotic hands, drones, and other various projects, with an impressively extended range (+100m for Urban zones).
RV1 features a built-in 1.3-inch display that allows users to interact with the Remote Controller itself and view sent data values in Real-Time, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience and making it easy to monitor and control your projects.

**To use RV1, you'll need an ESP based receiver (any board that has any microcontroller made by Esspressif)**, which means that it can be easily integrated into any of your existing robotics projects, making it extremly easy for users to implement in either a diy project or a commercial product.

With RV1, users can take complete control of their projects and unleash their creativity like never before, whether you're an professional embedded systems developer, an experienced robotics enthusiast or just starting out, RV1's user-friendly design ensures that it's easy to use for users of all levels. 

Take your robotics projects to the next level with the advanced wireless remote controller, RV1 made by TeXR team.
